PROJECTS
Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis and Progression Level Tracking Using MRI Data  May 2025
• Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict progressive Alzheimer’s stages (0–3) using MRI, clinical, and
neuropsychiatric data.
• Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy,
Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
• Tuned neural network model achieved highest F1-score ( 0.74 test), outperforming baseline classifiers in
detecting advanced AD stages.
Weather App  Nov 2024
• Developed a responsive weather application that fetches real-time weather data for any city using the
OpenWeatherMap API.
• Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the frontend interface and handle API interactions.
• Implemented functionalities to display current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions
with intuitive visuals.
Impact Of Climate Change on Incidence of Vector Borne Diseases  Sep 2024
• “Impact of Climate Change on Incidence of Vector-Borne Diseases” focused on analyzing dengue patterns in
India.
• Python (Google Colab), Power BI, MS Excel, Matplotlib, Jupyter, OPTICS and DBSCAN clustering.
• Found a positive correlation between rising temperatures and increasing dengue cases; OPTICS outperformed
DBSCAN in clustering accuracy.
